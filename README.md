# PySpark-Cookiecutter
---

This project was initially forked from [PySpark-Boilerplate](https://github.com/ekampf/PySpark-Boilerplate) because 
it has worked well for me in the past and I wanted to create a base template that could be used to easily get up and 
running with a new PySpark project. 

## Setup

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher):

    pip install -U cookiecutter

Create a project from this template:

    cookiecutter https://github.com/dbk138/pyspark-cookiecutter.git
